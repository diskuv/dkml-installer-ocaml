ShortDescription: The Windows-friendly distribution of OCaml.
Description: |-
  The Diskuv OCaml distribution is an open-source set of software that supports software development in pure OCaml. The distribution's strengths are its:

  ✓ full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind
  ✓ laser focus on "native" development (desktop software, mobile apps and embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like Visual Studio and Xcode
  ✓ ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands; high school students should be able to use it
  ✓ security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

  These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

  * Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at Esy and Reason
  * Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at Mirage OS
  * Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old OCaml on Debian, etc. works well
  * Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well
  * Wanting quick installations? Use anything but Diskuv OCaml! Diskuv OCaml will conduct from-source builds unless it can guarantee (and code sign) the binaries are reproducible. Today that means a lot of compiling.
