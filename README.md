# DkML Installer

DkML is an open-source set of software that supports software development with mixed OCaml/C development. DkML's strengths are its:

* full compatibility with OCaml standards like Opam, Dune and ocamlfind
* laser focus on "native" development (desktop software, mobile apps and embedded software) through support for the standard native compilers like Visual Studio
  and Xcode
* ease-of-use through simplified installers and simple productivity commands; high school, college and university students should be
  able to use it
* security through reproducibility, versioning and from-source builds

These alternatives may be better depending on your use case:

* Developing in a Javascript first environment? Have a look at [Esy and Reason](https://esy.sh/)
* Developing operating system kernels? Have a look at [Mirage OS](https://mirage.io/)
* Developing Linux server software like web servers? Plain old [OCaml on Debian, etc.](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running) works well
* Writing compilers or proofs? Plain old OCaml works really well

The DkML Installer for OCaml generates and distributes installers for
the DkML distribution. Windows, Debian/x86_64 and macOS/Silicon are ready today.
